# Uplift Marketplace
Background
The Uplift Marketplace project is at the forefront of driving positive change by leveraging Web 3.0 technologies to tackle global poverty. In 2019, the World Bank reported that 719 million people, constituting 9.2% of the global population, lived on less than $2.15 per day. While this statistic reflects extreme poverty, broader measures, such as multidimensional poverty and national poverty lines, highlight the complexity of the issue.

## Problem Statement
Small business owners, especially those in low-income countries, face daunting challenges due to high transaction fees, hindering economic stability and limiting social impact. The existing economic landscape often constrains the growth of these businesses, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Uplift Marketplace is poised to address these challenges by offering a platform that facilitates fair transactions, supports economic stability, and empowers businesses to thrive.
